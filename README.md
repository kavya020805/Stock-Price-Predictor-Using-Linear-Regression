# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Predictor Using Linear Regression

A simple and interpretable stock price forecasting model for Goldman Sachs stock using linear regression. This project applies feature engineering and predictive modeling on historical stock data to estimate the next-day closing price.

---

## ðŸ§ª Project Workflow

1. Load and clean historical stock data  
2. Engineer meaningful features (returns, moving averages, volatility)  
3. Visualize correlations  
4. Train a linear regression model  
5. Evaluate prediction accuracy using RÂ² and MSE  
6. Visualize predicted vs actual prices

## ðŸ“Š Visualizations

### ðŸ”¥ Feature Correlation Heatmap

This heatmap visualizes the correlation between each feature and the target (next-day close). Strong correlations help identify which indicators are most predictive of future prices.

> **Interpretation:** Features with higher absolute correlation values may contribute more significantly to the regression model.

### ðŸ“ˆ Actual vs Predicted Prices

This scatter plot compares the predicted stock prices (from the model) to the actual next-day prices. A perfect model would align all points on the red dashed line.

> **Interpretation:** The closer the points are to the red line, the better the model performance.
